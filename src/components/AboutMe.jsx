        <p className='description'>I’m <span>Arena Smith</span>. UI/UX Designer. I’ve always wanted my work to be part of a bigger self, to be bound with innovation and transcend through people’s daily lives, and I bring a fresh perspective and creative problem-solving approach to create designs and experiences people love to use.
I'm quick with my ideas and thorough with my research. Observing and applying is my key to creating far-reaching designs.  I'm always open to communication and ready for new projects!</p>
